My iterative development process consisted of building each function or block of code, testing it with what was written before, fixing any issues, and then either moving on to the next function or scrapping the failed one and rewriting or redesigning it completely. I rewrote some functions multiple times in order to streamline the program and make it easier to understand.

When developing this program, I came across significant difficulties in creating both the functions for reversing and spacing the answer string. I had to reverse the answer string to account for DNA prime ends, and I spent a considerable amount of time trying workarounds, until I eventually discovered the reversed() function, which does the entire job in one line. For spacing, I spent multiple hours trying various complicated workarounds using for loops and other ideas, which turned out to be impossible without hardcoding. The solution was to use the join() function in conjunction with a for loop to insert spaces into the string.
