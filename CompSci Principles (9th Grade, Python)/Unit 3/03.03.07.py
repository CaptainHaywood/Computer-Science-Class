03.03 Reflection Statement James Haywood

This unit was fun! I enjoyed making programs that might actually have practical
applications instead of HERE, IT DRAWS HEXAGONS. All of the assignments were
relatively easy, except for Blackjack, which was pain, suffering, and trial
and error. Maybe try replacing it with something simpler, like Crazy Eights
or War?
