04.02 Reflection Statement James Haywood

Overall I enjoyed this unit, largely because it was easy for me (I've
built a computer in the past, so I have a general idea of what to look
for.) One thing I would suggest would be adding some more requirements
to Assignment 2, like a certain CPU clock speed, case size, etc.
