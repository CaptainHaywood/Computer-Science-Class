# Computer-Science-Class
An assortment of programming projects for my computer science classes, going back to eigth grade. Everything here is public domain, so if you find a use for my hackjob code, then go wild. Do be warned that directly copying it will likely set off plagiarism filters!

Most of the Java projects are IntelliJ-based, but a few of the earlier ones were made on BlueJ.
