I didn't really like this chapter. Some parts of it were annoyingly repetetive (like the ones with a, b, c subvariants and so on) while others had a massive spike in difficulty and were confusingly worded. Such as Nim, which I wrote as one program (I somehow managed to get really off-course when we did it in class) only to find out at the last possible minute that I needed all my AI to be in its own class, MAKING IT LATE.
