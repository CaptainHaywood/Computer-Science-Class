Ref Statement
03.01 James Haywood

Turtle is both the best and worst thing ever. ITs good because
you get to make cool things, but its bad because it gives me a headache
trying to rememeber where the damn thing is facing on Line 75, Column 10.
Other than that I had fun with this unit and there's nothing really wrong with it.
