I found the projects in this unit kinda repetitive - a significant chunk, starting at program 8, can easily be done
by making 10-second modifications to the previous program, which got kind of annoying.

Example:
Program 12: Square a number that the user enters
Program 13: Multiply a number entered by the user by an exponent entered by the user.

Program 13 literally took me like 15 seconds.

I get that it's meant to build up the knowledge of first time programmers, but this is just ridiculous to somebody
who's coming back from a previous CompSci class like me.

(Hey, you wanted our honest opinion!)
