The projects would be great if I weren't a beginner. I did all this stuff in
Mr. Salatich's class, so it took me about 30 seconds to complete each program.
When I did similar assignments in eighth grade, it took significantly longer.

All I'm saying is that this unit was boring for me but would be really helpful
to a beginner.
