1. Store data long-term, slower access speed, on a magnetic disk, like documents
2. Store data short-term, faster access speed, like games or in-progress documents
3. Crunch numbers to make the computer run and do work
4. RAM is volatile, it dissapears when the power is cut. HDDs are non-volatile, the data remains even without power. In addition, RAM is faster than an HDD.
5. When opening, say, Rimworld, the HDD first loads the data from the game executable file on-disk into RAM. Then the CPU fetches the data from the RAM and executes the game, sending data back and forth between the RAM and itself to continually update the screen and run the game.
