I found the projects in this unit a lot more interesting than the previous
units, but they were still really easy, especially seeing as all we had to do
for the more complex programs was modify some example code. I would have
enjoyed it more if we were told to write those programs from scratch instead
of using the example code.

I wonder what Unit 5 will be?
